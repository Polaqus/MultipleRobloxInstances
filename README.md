# MultipleRobloxInstances
A simple application that allows for multiple Roblox instances.

## About
Run this before launching a Roblox instance and you'll be able to run several instances on different accounts.

## Differences in this fork
I made the window hidden so you don't have to worry about accidentally closing it

**multipleRoblox.exe** - will hide after 5 seconds  
**multipleRoblox_silent.exe** - will hide right away so you can safely put it into shell:autostart
